net.cgrand.regex-cljs is a clojurescript port of

"net.cgrand.regex":https://github.com/cgrand/regex which is a Clojure notation (DSL) for regexes.

Regexes are already a DSL of their own but a write-only DSL.

This DSL allows to reuse regexes or parts of them and also adds support for named groups.

This project started as a toy/lab for the DSL course at "Conj Labs Brussels":http://conj-labs.eu back in June 2010.

<pre>
  (def datestamp-re
    (let [d {\0 \9}]
      (regex [d d d d :as :year] \- [d d :as :month] \- [d d :as :day])))

  regex=> (exec datestamp-re "2007-10-23")
  {:day "23", :month "10", :year "2007", nil "2007-10-23"}
  regex=> (exec datestamp-re "20X7-10-23")
  nil
